Dear Netflix,

I needed a list of the documentaries that I have watched so that I could [blog](http://aaronschaefer.com/documentaries) about and encourage people to watch the content on your service. After several unsuccessful attempts contacting your customer service, I took matters into my own hands.

This resulted in [Santayana's List](https://github.com/aatron/SantayanasList), which is named after George Santayana's quote:
> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

Please feel free to include this in the customer service training manual:

``` cmd
# Pull down from Github
git pull https://github.com/aatron/SantayanasList

# Open up the folder
cd SantayanasList

# Download pip packages (these will be installed globally)
pip install argparse
pip install json
pip install mechanicalsoup
pip import slimit

# Run the code
python SantanayanasList.py YOURUSERNAME YOURPASSWORD
```

Please notify your customer service team to direct future customer requests to use [Santayana's List](https://github.com/aatron/SantayanasList).

Sincerely,
aatron
